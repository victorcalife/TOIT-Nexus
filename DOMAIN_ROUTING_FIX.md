# TOIT Nexus Domain Routing Fix

## Problem Identified

The domain-based routing was not working correctly because the static file middleware was serving files for ALL domains, including the API domain (`api.toit.com.br`). This caused:

1. API endpoints like `/api/health` to be intercepted by static file serving instead of reaching the API routes
2. Mixed content serving where API requests were being treated as static file requests

## Solution Implemented

I've fixed the routing by modifying how static files are served:

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
// This served static files for ALL domains
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client', 'dist')));
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// This serves static files ONLY for supnexus.toit.com.br domain
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const host = req.get('host');
  const xForwardedHost = req.get('x-forwarded-host');
  const realHost = xForwardedHost || host;
  
  // Serve static files only for supnexus domain
  if (realHost === 'supnexus.toit.com.br') {
    console.log(`üìÅ [STATIC] Servindo assets para: ${realHost}`);
    express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client', 'dist'))(req, res, next);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```

## How It Works Now

1. **nexus.toit.com.br** - Serves only the landing page and general assets
2. **supnexus.toit.com.br** - Serves the React admin portal with all static assets
3. **api.toit.com.br** - Serves only API endpoints without interference from static files

## Key Changes

1. Wrapped static file middleware in domain-checking logic
2. Separated asset serving by domain:
   - General assets only for `nexus.toit.com.br`
   - React build assets only for `supnexus.toit.com.br`
   - No static assets for `api.toit.com.br`
3. Maintained all API routes functionality
4. Preserved the SPA fallback for React Router on `supnexus.toit.com.br`

## Testing

After redeploying, you should test:
1. `https://nexus.toit.com.br` ‚Üí Should show landing page
2. `https://supnexus.toit.com.br` ‚Üí Should show React admin portal
3. `https://api.toit.com.br` ‚Üí Should show API information JSON
4. `https://api.toit.com.br/api/health` ‚Üí Should return health check JSON
5. `https://api.toit.com.br/api/auth/login` ‚Üí Should handle authentication
6. All other API endpoints should work correctly

This fix ensures proper separation of concerns between your three domains and allows each to serve its intended content without interference.
