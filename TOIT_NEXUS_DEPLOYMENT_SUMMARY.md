# TOIT Nexus Deployment Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Domain Routing Problem
**Problem**: Static file middleware was serving files for ALL domains, including the API domain (`api.toit.com.br`), causing API endpoints to be intercepted by static file serving instead of reaching the API routes.

**Solution**: Modified static file serving to be domain-specific:
- General assets only for `nexus.toit.com.br`
- React build assets only for `supnexus.toit.com.br`
- No static assets for `api.toit.com.br`
- Wrapped static file middleware in domain-checking logic

### 2. Dependency Sync Issue
**Problem**: Mismatch between `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for `drizzle-kit` version causing deployment errors.

**Solution**: Updated `package.json` to match the version in `package-lock.json`:
- Changed drizzle-kit version from `^0.25.0` to `^0.31.4`

### 3. Backend Import Path Issues
**Problem**: Incorrect relative import paths in backend files causing module resolution errors.

**Solution**: Fixed all import paths in server/dist directory files:
- Changed imports from `../shared/schema.js` to `../../shared/schema.js`

### 4. Database Connection Configuration
**Problem**: Using `drizzle-orm/neon-serverless` which is incompatible with Railway's PostgreSQL.

**Solution**: Updated `db.js` to use `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` for Railway compatibility.

### 5. Package Configuration Improvements
**Problem**: Missing configuration for ES modules and essential scripts.

**Solution**: 
- Added `"type": "module"` to root `package.json`
- Added essential npm scripts including `db:push`, `db:setup`, `deploy`, and `railway:start`

## Current Status

✅ Domain routing logic fixed and deployed
✅ Dependency synchronization resolved
✅ Backend import paths corrected
✅ Database connection properly configured for Railway
✅ Package configuration updated with ES module support
✅ Essential npm scripts added

## Required Actions in Railway Dashboard

### Environment Variables
1. Change `API_URL` from `api.nexus.com.br` to `api.toit.com.br`
2. Replace `SESSION_SECRET` value with a strong random secret (current value is weak)
3. Configure actual Stripe API keys:
   - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Domain Configuration
1. Add custom domains in Railway project settings:
   - `nexus.toit.com.br`
   - `supnexus.toit.com.br`
   - `api.toit.com.br`

### DNS Configuration
1. Set up CNAME records for each domain pointing to your Railway service URL:
   ```
   CNAME nexus.toit.com.br → YOUR_RAILWAY_SERVICE_URL
   CNAME supnexus.toit.com.br → YOUR_RAILWAY_SERVICE_URL
   CNAME api.toit.com.br → YOUR_RAILWAY_SERVICE_URL
   ```

## Testing After Configuration

Once all configurations are complete, test these endpoints:

### Frontend Domains
- `https://nexus.toit.com.br` → Should show landing page
- `https://supnexus.toit.com.br` → Should show React admin portal

### Backend API Endpoints
- `https://api.toit.com.br` → Should show API information JSON
- `https://api.toit.com.br/api/health` → Should return health check JSON
- `https://api.toit.com.br/api/auth/login` → Should handle authentication
- `https://api.toit.com.br/api/tenants` → Should return tenants list

## Database Setup

After deployment with proper configurations:
1. Run database migrations with `railway run npm run db:push`
2. Execute database setup with `railway run npm run db:setup`

## Security Recommendations

1. Generate a strong `SESSION_SECRET` using a password generator or crypto library
2. Store Stripe keys securely and never commit them to version control
3. Use Railway's encrypted environment variables for sensitive data
4. Regularly rotate secrets and keys for security best practices

## Next Steps

1. Update environment variables in Railway dashboard
2. Configure custom domains in Railway project settings
3. Set up DNS CNAME records with your domain provider
4. Redeploy the application with `railway up`
5. Run database migrations and setup commands
6. Test all endpoints and domain routing functionality
7. Monitor logs for any issues with the new configuration

The TOIT Nexus platform should now be fully operational with proper domain-based routing once all these configurations are completed.
