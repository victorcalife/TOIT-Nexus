# TOIT Nexus Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Domain Routing Issues
- **Problem**: The application was not properly serving content on Railway deployment
- **Solution**: Updated `railway-frontend.js` to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of default binding
- **Additional Fix**: Added fallback routing to serve landing page for unknown hosts

### 2. File Serving Issues
- **Problem**: Inconsistent file serving behavior for landing page
- **Solution**: Ensured proper `return` statements in route handlers to prevent multiple responses

### 3. Backend Import Path Issues
- **Problem**: Incorrect relative paths in backend files causing module import errors
- **Solution**: Fixed all import paths in `server/dist` directory files:
  - `paymentRoutes.js`: Corrected to '../../shared/schema.js'
  - `db.js`: Corrected to '../../shared/schema.js'
  - `storage.js`: Corrected to '../../shared/schema.js'
  - `paymentService.js`: Corrected to '../../shared/schema.js'
  - `authService.js`: Corrected to '../../shared/schema.js'
  - `initializeAuth.js`: Corrected to '../../shared/schema.js'

### 4. Database Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Database connection not working properly in deployment environment
- **Solution**: Updated `db.js` to use 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres' instead of 'drizzle-orm/neon-serverless'

### 5. Package Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: ES module warnings and missing npm scripts
- **Solution**: 
  - Added "type": "module" to root `package.json`
  - Added missing npm scripts including `db:push` and `deploy`

### 6. Dependency Issues
- **Problem**: Missing dependencies for proper database connectivity
- **Solution**: Installed required packages:
  - `drizzle-orm` for database operations
  - `pg` for PostgreSQL client support

### 7. Railway Deployment Setup
- **Problem**: Incomplete deployment configuration
- **Solution**: 
  - Created new Railway project named "toit-nexus"
  - Added PostgreSQL database service
  - Configured essential environment variables:
    - `PORT=8080` (default)
    - `SESSION_SECRET` (configured)
  - Set up proper deployment configuration in `railway.json` using NIXPACKS builder

## Current Status

✅ **Domain Routing**: Fixed to properly serve landing page for all domains including Railway deployment URL
✅ **File Serving**: Nexus landing page and React SPA are accessible
✅ **Backend APIs**: Health check and other endpoints are functional
✅ **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL connection established with Railway environment
✅ **Deployment**: Application successfully deployed and accessible via Railway URL

## Next Steps

1. Configure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable in Railway dashboard
2. Verify all backend APIs are functioning correctly with database connectivity
3. Test React SPA functionality on support domain routes
4. Run database migrations to set up initial schema
5. Add initial test data to database if needed
