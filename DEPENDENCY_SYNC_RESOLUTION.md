# TOIT Nexus Dependency Sync Resolution

## Issue Identified
During the Railway deployment process, we encountered a dependency synchronization error:

```
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json are in sync. Please update your lock file with `npm install` before continuing.
npm error Invalid: lock file's drizzle-kit@0.31.4 does not satisfy drizzle-kit@0.25.0
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a version mismatch between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`:
- `package.json` specified `drizzle-kit@^0.25.0`
- `package-lock.json` had `drizzle-kit@0.31.4`

This mismatch occurred because the lock file was created with a newer version of drizzle-kit than what was specified in package.json.

## Resolution Applied
We resolved the issue by updating `package.json` to match the version in `package-lock.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2",
  "drizzle-kit": "^0.31.4",
  "ts-node": "^10.9.2",
  "typescript": "^5.2.2"
}
```

This change ensures that both files are in sync and allows `npm ci` to proceed correctly during the Railway build process.

## Additional Steps
We also ensured that the client application is properly built:
1. Ran `npm run build` in the client directory
2. Verified that the `client/dist` directory contains the built files

## Why This Approach
Rather than downgrading the lock file to match package.json, we upgraded package.json to match the lock file because:
1. The newer version (0.31.4) was already working in the lock file
2. This approach maintains consistency with the existing development environment
3. It avoids potential issues that could arise from downgrading dependencies

## Next Steps
The application should now deploy successfully to Railway. After deployment, you should:
1. Configure the custom domains in Railway dashboard
2. Set up DNS CNAME records pointing to your Railway service URL
3. Configure all required environment variables in Railway dashboard
4. Run database migrations with `railway run npm run db:push`
5. Execute database setup with `railway run npm run db:setup`

This resolution ensures that your deployment process will work smoothly without dependency conflicts.
