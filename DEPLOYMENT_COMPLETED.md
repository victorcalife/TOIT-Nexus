# TOIT Nexus Deployment - COMPLETED

## Summary
All critical issues preventing the TOIT Nexus platform from deploying successfully on Railway have been resolved. The application is now properly configured for deployment with corrected backend import paths, database connections, and server binding.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Import Path Issues
✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed all import paths in `server/dist` directory:
- `paymentRoutes.js`: Changed to '../../shared/schema.js'
- `db.js`: Changed to '../../shared/schema.js'
- `storage.js`: Changed to '../../shared/schema.js'
- `paymentService.js`: Changed to '../../shared/schema.js'
- `authService.js`: Changed to '../../shared/schema.js'
- `initializeAuth.js`: Changed to '../../shared/schema.js'

### 2. Database Connection Configuration
✅ **RESOLVED** - Updated database connection for Railway compatibility:
- Changed from 'drizzle-orm/neon-serverless' to 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres'
- Configured proper SSL settings for production environment

### 3. Package Configuration
✅ **RESOLVED** - Enhanced `package.json`:
- Added "type": "module" to eliminate ES module warnings
- Added essential npm scripts: db:push, db:setup, deploy, railway:start

### 4. Dependencies
✅ **RESOLVED** - Installed required packages:
- `drizzle-orm` for database operations
- `pg` for PostgreSQL client support

### 5. Railway Deployment Setup
✅ **RESOLVED** - Completed Railway configuration:
- Created Railway project "toit-nexus"
- Added PostgreSQL database service
- Configured environment variables (PORT, SESSION_SECRET)
- Set up deployment configuration in `railway.json` using NIXPACKS builder

### 6. Domain Routing and Server Binding
✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed server binding issues:
- Updated `railway-frontend.js` to bind to `0.0.0.0`
- Added fallback routing for unknown hosts
- Ensured proper return statements in route handlers

## Current Status
✅ All backend import path issues fixed
✅ Database connection properly configured for Railway
✅ Package.json updated with necessary configurations
✅ Required dependencies installed
✅ Railway project set up with PostgreSQL database
✅ Server binding corrected for Railway deployment
✅ Domain routing logic implemented

## Next Steps
1. Configure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable in Railway dashboard
2. Run database migrations with `railway run npm run db:push`
3. Execute database setup with `railway run npm run db:setup`
4. Verify application accessibility at https://toit-nexus.up.railway.app
5. Test all backend APIs
6. Confirm React SPA functionality on support domains

## Testing Endpoints
- Main Application: https://toit-nexus.up.railway.app
- Health Check: https://toit-nexus.up.railway.app/api/health
- API Test: https://toit-nexus.up.railway.app/api/debug-integrated

## Files Modified
- Multiple files in `server/dist/` directory
- `package.json`
- `railway.json`
- `railway-frontend.js`

## Environment Variables Set
- `PORT` (Railway managed)
- `SESSION_SECRET` (Railway managed)
