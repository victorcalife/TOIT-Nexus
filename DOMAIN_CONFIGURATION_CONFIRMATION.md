# TOIT Nexus Domain Configuration Confirmation

## Current Domain Setup

âœ… **CONFIRMED** - The domain-based routing is now properly configured as you requested:

### Frontend Domains
1. **nexus.toit.com.br** - Main landing page for clients
   - Serves `nexus-quantum-landing.html`
   - Used for marketing and client acquisition

2. **supnexus.toit.com.br** - React admin portal for TOIT team
   - Serves React application from `client/dist/`
   - Used for internal team operations

### Backend Domain
3. **api.toit.com.br** - Dedicated backend API endpoint
   - Serves all API endpoints under `/api/*`
   - Returns API information when accessed directly
   - Properly configured in CORS settings

## Implementation Verification

The server configuration has been updated to include:

1. **CORS Configuration** - Added `https://api.toit.com.br` to allowed origins
2. **Root Route Handler** - Properly detects and handles `api.toit.com.br` domain
3. **Fallback Route Handler** - Also detects and handles `api.toit.com.br` domain
4. **API Endpoints** - All backend services are accessible through this domain

## How It Works

When a request comes in, the server checks the host header:
- If it's `nexus.toit.com.br`, it serves the landing page
- If it's `supnexus.toit.com.br`, it serves the React admin portal
- If it's `api.toit.com.br`, it either:
  - Returns API information (for root requests)
  - Processes API endpoints (for `/api/*` requests)

## Next Steps

1. Configure custom domains in Railway dashboard:
   - nexus.toit.com.br
   - supnexus.toit.com.br
   - api.toit.com.br

2. Set up DNS CNAME records pointing to your Railway service URL

3. Configure all required environment variables in Railway dashboard

4. Run database migrations with `railway run npm run db:push`

5. Execute database setup with `railway run npm run db:setup`

The domain-based routing is now fully implemented and matches your requirements exactly.
